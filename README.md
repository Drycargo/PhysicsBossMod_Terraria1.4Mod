# PhysicsBossMod_Terraria1.4Mod
Mod of Physics-themed Bosses in Terraria, based on TModLoader

## Introduction
This is a **[TModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader)** based mod for the game Terraria. 
The initial intention of designing this mod is to implement Physics-related simulations into gaming, 
but not necessarily in the form of educational display like **[phet](https://phet.colorado.edu/)**. 
As a game mod, it should merge Physical patterns (Chaos, Quantums, Electromagnetism, Relativity, etc) into 
the various AI patterns of a boss fight.  
As a developer, I am personally interested in Physics simulations and animation display. 
I have developed a **[Special Relativity Simulator](https://github.com/Drycargo/SpecialRelativitySimulator-JAVA)** 
before, but have seldom created or witnessed a game with large-scale Physics patterns implemented into boss fights. 
These years, one of the Terraria Mods, **[Polarities](https://terrariamods.fandom.com/wiki/Polarities_Mod)**, has 
successfully implemented Physics and Math concepts (e.g., Electromagnetism and Fractals) into the game procedure; somewhat
inspired, I would like to seize the chance to develop my own Physics simulation-themed mod as a demonstration of my 
passion in Physics (and possibly animation effects).
*Currently, I do not intend to incorporate any background stories into this mod, nor do I intend to make it into a 
fully integrated mod with biomes, friendly NPC systems, comprehensive loots or events. This might subject to change.*

## Techniques
Based on TModLoader, this mod is implemented mainly with C# #. The implementation of visual effects also require some basic 
shaders written in HLSL an compiled by XNA Compiler (see reference list).
